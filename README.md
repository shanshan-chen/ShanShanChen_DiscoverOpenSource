# ShanShanChen_DiscoverOpenSource

“This project is part of the Discover Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.
Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesn’t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?

My response to the prompt is below:”

Delilah should contact organizations that are targeted toward minorities and underrepresented individuals. She can also take to social media to market her inclusive application.
